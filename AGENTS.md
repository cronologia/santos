# AGENTS.md — cronologia/santos

Operating guide for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repository.
Read this and `context.md` before making changes. The shared method lives in
`cronologia/core` (skills: sourcing-rules, bootstrap-project, mine-video,
dossier-research); the architecture rationale in `cronologia/fsp` → `docs/adrs/`.

## What this project is

A compiled static website documenting the chronology of **the canonization
paths of the seers of the major Marian apparitions** — Juan Diego
Cuauhtlatoatzin (Guadalupe), Catherine Labouré (rue du Bac), Bernadette
Soubirous (Lourdes), and Francisco and Jacinta Marto (Fátima).
A single JSON file is the source of truth; a zero-dependency Node script
compiles it into static HTML served by GitHub Pages.

**The rule that governs this repo above all others:** sanctity and miracles are
Church *judgments*. The dataset records who declared what, when, and in which
document — never that an apparition happened, and never a canonization as
authenticating one. See `context.md` § "The posture, stated once".

**Two places below are still the unadapted template and contradict this repo:**
`data/i18n/*.json` are described as machine-generated and not to be hand-edited;
here they are hand-authored by an LLM (`_meta.humanReviewed: false`) and *are*
the artifact to edit. And `saints/` — the per-saint research trail — is not
listed in the repository map below; see `saints/README.md`.

## Repository map

data/chronology.json     SOURCE OF TRUTH — facts, events, figures, organizations, references (hand-edited, English)
data/i18n/{es,pt}.json   MACHINE-GENERATED translation caches (written by scripts/translate.js; committed) — do NOT hand-edit
data/archives.json       MACHINE-GENERATED Wayback snapshot cache (written by scripts/archive-refs.js; committed)
data/glossary-terms.json VENDORED, PINNED list of cronologia/glossary term ids (written by scripts/sync-glossary-terms.js; committed) — validates [[term-id]] cross-links offline
data/places.json         VENDORED, PINNED copy of the cronologia/core gazetteer (written by scripts/sync-places.js; committed) — coordinates for the optional placesMap renderer; only needed when placesMap is declared
src/styles.css           Stylesheet (copied into the build)
src/latam.svg            VENDORED Latin America base map (Natural Earth, public domain) — used by the `map` tier renderer; regenerate with scripts/gen-latam-svg.js (dev-only, needs npm)
src/world-land.json      COMMITTED world basemap for the placesMap renderer (Natural Earth 1:110m, public domain; see its _meta) — only needed when placesMap is declared

## Multi-language (i18n) & SEO

The site ships in **English (default, authoritative), Spanish and Portuguese**.
`es`/`pt` are **machine-translated** from the committed caches in `data/i18n/`
and carry a visible "machine-translated" disclaimer. The language is a path
segment **after** the project (`/<repo>/{en|pt|es}/…`) because GitHub Pages
serves each repo under `https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/`; `/<repo>/` redirects
to the visitor's locale. See `adrs/0001-multilingual.md` and `cronologia/core#9`.

- **No backend, ever.** The site is static HTML on GitHub Pages; nothing
  translates at runtime. `es`/`pt` are **pre-authored, committed** caches in
  `data/i18n/` baked into the static pages at build time. Fill them by authoring
  the translations and committing them; `node scripts/translate.js --stats`
  reports which strings still need one. (An env-configured MT service is an
  optional convenience — not required.) Keep them fresh when English changes.
- Localization is **data-level** (a key-based walk in `build.js`), so every
  renderer — chronology, genealogy, charts, glossary links — is covered.
- **Never translated:** reference titles/publishers, proper names, URLs, dates, ids.
- **Subtrees where the general rule misfires get their own allowlist.**
  `TRANSLATABLE_KEYS` decides the dataset at large; `SUBTREE_TRANSLATABLE` in
  `build.js` maps a subtree's key to the keys that are prose *inside* it, and
  the walk resolves it as it descends (nearest enclosing subtree wins, and it
  is sticky). `references` ships: bibliography passes through verbatim except
  `publisherNote`, which is the project's own voice. A repo whose dataset has
  another such subtree adds one entry in the `subtree-allowlists` ADOPT block —
  in `olavo`, a bibliography where `note`/`sourceNote`/`label`/`blurb`/`role`/
  `when` are prose and `title` is a book's name and must not be translated.
  `test/i18n-completeness.test.js` parses that map and MIRRORS the walk; its
  last test drives `localizeData` with a marking dictionary and asserts the two
  select exactly the same strings, so the audit cannot drift from the compiler
  in either direction.
- Each page emits localized `<title>`/description/OG/Twitter, a self canonical,
  `hreflang` (en/es/pt + x-default) and JSON-LD; the build also writes
  `sitemap.xml` (with hreflang alternates) and `robots.txt`.

## Optional visualizations (data-driven, off by default)

The compiler renders extra visual sections only when the corresponding key
exists in `data/chronology.json`; when a key is absent the output is
byte-identical to a build without the feature. Shapes are shown in
`data/chronology.example.json`; the validator checks all of them.

- **`meta.vizChips[]`** — header pill links to the visual sections
  (`{ "href": "#lineage", "label": "🌳 Genealogy" }`).
- **`lineage`** (alias `episcopalLineage`, the original fsspx key) — genealogy
  / lineage trees (`renderLineageSection`). One `trees[]` entry per branch;
  `separate: true` sets a branch apart visually for lines that must NOT be
  read as connected (the fsspx Thục/Palmar pattern). **Typed edges**: a node
  with `edge: "indirect"` (plus optional `edgeLabel`) renders a DASHED
  connector — a reference/association, not a direct consecration/initiation —
  and a solid/dashed legend appears automatically (labels overridable via
  `edgeLegend`). With no typed edges the markup is byte-identical to the
  fsspx site's genealogy section. `heading`/`navLabel` default to
  "Episcopal genealogy"/"Genealogy".
- **`branchTimeline`** — horizontal "subway diagram" of an organization's
  divisions (`renderBranchTimeline`): a trunk line with labeled branches
  forking off at dated points (e.g. SSPX → SSPV 1983 → Resistance 2012 →
  2026). Static inline SVG — print scales it to the page via its viewBox;
  on screen it sits in its own horizontal-scroll container (`.viz-scroll`).
  Lanes follow listing order; `from` forks a branch off an earlier branch;
  `end` terminates a branch (dot) instead of running to the right edge.
  Every trunk/branch entry needs `sources[]` — the figure's claims are cited
  in its `<figcaption>` list.
- **`numbersChart`** — contested-numbers / series chart (`renderNumbersChart`):
  for figures that must NOT be silently unified (e.g. a movement's
  self-reported participant count vs. an external survey's population share).
  Each `series[]` is drawn as its OWN panel on its OWN axis, with its OWN
  `unit`, its OWN `sourceLabel` (WHO reported it), and its OWN `sources[]` —
  the series are never merged onto one scale. A required `unitNote` renders the
  explicit **"not directly comparable"** banner. `axisMax` sets that series'
  axis top (defaults to its largest point); each `points[]` entry has a numeric
  `value`, a human-readable attributed `display`, and an optional `year`. The
  `<figcaption>` cites every series. `heading`/`navLabel` default to "Numbers".
  Sits in its own `.viz-scroll` container; prints as static panels.
- **`map`** — country tier map (`renderTierMap`): a static choropleth of the
  vendored Latin America base map, the tl presence-map pattern. Tiers are a
  per-repo, DATA-DECLARED vocabulary (`tiers: [{ id, label }]`, 1–4 entries,
  listing order = visual rank) — what a tier means is an editorial claim, so
  it lives in the data with its legend label, never in the renderer. Each
  `countries[]` entry (`code` ISO alpha-2, must exist in src/latam.svg;
  `name`; `tier`; cited `note`) fills its country and gets a hover/focus
  tooltip (aria-live caption) plus a citation card. `unlistedLabel` is
  REQUIRED: on a contested subject, an unfilled country is a statement too,
  and the legend must say what it means. Distinct from `placesMap` (event
  pins): this says what KIND of place a country is in the story, not where
  events happened. fsp's year-slider membership map is a declared follow-up
  (core#3), not covered by this key yet.

- **`meta.threads`** — the per-repo lane taxonomy (core#23) and, once declared,
  the **swimlanes** figure (`renderSwimlanes`): one row per lane, one column per
  decade, each cell that lane's event count, rendered as a real `<table>`
  because the data is categorical-over-time. Declaring a taxonomy is what turns
  the figure on — a classification the site keeps but never shows would be
  latent editorialising. Three rules the renderer enforces and any redesign must
  keep: `meta.threads.note` renders WITH the figure (it is the visible statement
  that the lanes are a reading); every lane's `basis` renders below it with its
  citations; and lane labels render VERBATIM, because a label may carry a
  load-bearing hedge ("Antecedents (attributed, not adopted)"). Gap collapsing is
  shared with the spine via `decadeColumns()`, so two figures on one page cannot
  disagree about the same gap.

Print baseline: `src/styles.css` ships an `@media print` block (nav/chips
hidden, figures `break-inside: avoid`, the subway SVG scaled to page width) —
extend it when adding a new visualization.

## Thread lanes (optional, off by default — schema only; renderer pending, core#23)

Events may carry `threads: string[]` naming which parallel storyline(s) an
event belongs to (always an array — cross-cutting events belong to more than
one). The vocabulary is **per-repo and editorial**: it must be declared in
`meta.threads`, never invented in code or derived by clustering the text:

```json
"meta": {
  "threads": {
    "note": "<visible editorial statement: these lanes are a reading of the chronology, not a neutral fact>",
    "lanes": [
      { "id": "rome-relations", "label": "Relations with Rome",
        "basis": "<what grounds this lane — the actor's own periodization, a scholarly framework… cite it>",
        "sources": ["optional-ref-id"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

`scripts/validate-data.js` enforces: unknown lane id on an event → error;
`threads` used without a declared taxonomy → error; missing `note` or a lane
missing `basis` → error; **absent field → valid** (no flag day), and a dataset
without the key builds byte-identically. Choosing the lanes is an editorial
decision governed by the sourcing-rules skill ("Thread taxonomies are a
reading") — decide and record it per repo before tagging events. The swimlane
renderer is a follow-up (core#23 → #22); until it ships the field is inert in
the build.

## Glossary cross-links (optional, off by default)

Prose fields can link into the shared **Cronologia glossary**
(`https://cronologia.github.io/glossary/<term-id>/`) instead of re-explaining a
term, using an inline marker:

- `[[term-id]]` — link whose visible text is the id (e.g. `[[schism]]`).
- `[[term-id|visible text]]` — link with custom visible text
  (e.g. `[[latae-sententiae|latae sententiae]]`).

`term-id` is a glossary slug (`[a-z0-9]` then `[a-z0-9-]*`). Markers are
expanded **after** HTML-escaping and only when a `[[` is present, so a field
with no marker renders byte-for-byte identically to a build without the feature
(the same opt-in contract as the visualizations above). Markers are honored in
the main prose fields: `facts[].value`, `events[].text`, `figures[].role` /
`.notes`, `organizations[].relation` / `.notes`, and `disambiguation.items[].text`.

**Validation is offline and deterministic.** `data/glossary-terms.json` is a
*pinned, vendored* copy of the glossary's term-id list — the build never fetches
it, matching this repo's no-network-in-build rule (only the out-of-band
`archive-refs.js` / `sync-glossary-terms.js` scripts touch the network).
`scripts/validate-data.js` scans every string field for `[[…]]` markers and
**fails the build** on any id not in that pinned list. Refresh the list after
the glossary changes and commit the diff:

```
node scripts/sync-glossary-terms.js                       # sibling ../glossary or the published raw JSON
node scripts/sync-glossary-terms.js ../glossary/data/glossary.json   # explicit local source
```

## Link-health checker (out-of-band / CI only)

The references ARE the product, so link-rot is tracked automatically.
`scripts/check-links.js` reads every `references[].url` and reports, per URL:
its HTTP status (a `HEAD` probe, falling back to a **ranged `GET`** when HEAD is
unsupported or blocked); whether it redirected, plus a **soft-404 heuristic**
(a redirect — or a 200 — whose page `<title>` no longer matches the reference's
declared title, or reads as a not-found/parking page, is flagged **SUSPECT**);
and whether an Internet Archive snapshot exists. A URL that is **dead or suspect
AND has no snapshot** is marked `priorityArchive` — top of the queue for
`scripts/archive-refs.js`.

- **It hits the live network, so it is NEVER part of the build** (the build is
  network-free). Run it out of band or in CI:
  `node scripts/check-links.js --json report.json --md issue.md`.
- **Politeness / semantics:** ≥ 1 request/second (global throttle), a
  User-Agent that names the project, bounded per-request timeout. `403`/`429`
  (and `5xx`/timeouts) are **INCONCLUSIVE, never "dead"** — many publishers
  block bots or HEAD; only real `4xx` (404/410/451…) count as dead.
- **It never edits `data/chronology.json`.** Fixing rot (correct the URL, or
  archive it) is a human decision.
- `.github/workflows/link-health.yml` runs it weekly on GitHub runners
  (`schedule` + `workflow_dispatch`) and opens/updates a **single** "Link health
  report" issue with the failures. Like `wayback.yml`, it runs in CI precisely
  so it never routes around a sandbox's egress policy (fsp ADR-0006).
- Offline helpers (title parsing, the soft-404 rule, status classification, the
  Wayback parser) are unit-tested in `test/link-health.test.js`.

## Working agreements

1. **Edit data, not output.** Change `data/chronology.json`, run
   `node build.js`, commit the regenerated `docs/` in the same change.
2. **Keep the build green.** `node scripts/validate-data.js`, `node --test`
   and `node build.js` must all pass; CI fails if `docs/` drifts.
3. **Cite every fact; flag every uncertainty; attribute every contested
   characterization.** The validator enforces non-empty `sources[]`.
4. **A merged PR is finished** — branch fresh from `main` for new work.

## Data quality & sourcing rules

<Adapt the subject-specific rules here: the project's disambiguations, its
contested terrain, its primary sources. Keep the five core rules from the
sourcing-rules skill verbatim in spirit.>

**If this project derives a searchable corpus** from PDFs, captions or scans,
it ships a test beside the corpus asserting its SHAPE — nothing ending
mid-sentence, more than one content unit per source document, a size floor and
no runt files, no glyph doubling, and the field the corpus was built to mine
present on every record. A corpus that is silently 20% of itself answers
"never" to questions whose answer is not never; a positive control proves the
search worked, not that the corpus is entire. See
`core/adr/0006-derived-corpora-ship-an-integrity-test.md` and the reference
implementation in `cronologia/fsp` → `test/declaration-corpus.test.js`.
